**Personal Linkki local transport Info Screen**

A personal bus stop info screen, so I can see my nearest bus stops schedule at a glance. All four stops together, or one stop at a time.

Based on Linkki's open data, downloadable from following link: 
https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v2/waltti/LINKKI.zip

Database (in case of Linkki's data) needs to be merged from at least 4 different tables and merged to JSON to suit this apps use.
